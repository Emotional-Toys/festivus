## The Festivus Speech Synthesizer Project
 
When crafting intelligent software it is beneficial that such systems use speech as their main way of communicating with humans so that it is accessible by the greatest number of people. To this end, this project is inspried by the original incarnation developed at CSTR, University of Edinburgh. The project was originally started by Alan W Black and Paul Taylor. Professor Black has noted in email conversations of the "oldness" of their original system and here we work to make it future-proof.

Festivus offers a general framework for building speech synthesis systems as well as including examples of various modules.  As a whole it offers full text to speech through a number APIs: from shell level, though a Scheme command interpreter, as a C++ library, and an Emacs interface.  Festivus is focused primarily upon English but is extendible into many multi-lingual contexts when used with [RHVoice](https://github.com/RHVoice/RHVoice).

The system is written in C++ and uses the Edinburgh Speech Tools for low level architecture and has a Scheme (SIOD) based command interpreter for control.  Documentation is given in the FSF texinfo format which can generate, a printed manual, info files and HTML.

## Installing Festivus

Festivus should run on both `amd64` and `arm64` Linux.
